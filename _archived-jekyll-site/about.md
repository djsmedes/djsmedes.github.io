Welcome to Daniel Smedema's blog. I expect this will only be of interest to people who already know me personally, but just in case you don't, here's a brief bio.

I was born in Indianapolis in '92, and grew up in the south side suburbs in Perry Township. I graduated valedictorian from Southport High School in 2011, and went on to earn a dual degree from Indiana University in Bloomington as a Wells Scholar: a BS in Cognitive Science with a minor in Economics from the College of Arts and Sciences, and a BS in Computer Science from what is now known as the Lundy School. In the summer between my junior and senior year, I lived in Berlin and worked as a research intern at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. During my senior year, I was on the Board of Aeons, a student advisory committee to the university president.

My first job out of college was as a software developer for Epic Systems Corporation - the one that makes electronic medical records, not the Epic that makes video games. I built features and fixed bugs in the part of the software that anesthesia clinicians use to document med and blood administrations during surgical procedures.
