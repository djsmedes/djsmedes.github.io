This is kind of a spin-off from my previous post. I realized I was starting to get a bit long-winded, so I split out the advice on communication in personal relationships into its own post. But that means I'm not going to go back over the advice I gave on communication in that post, which _absolutely_ still applies in personal relationships. Listening, listening, listening! Go read the post.

However, the better you know someone, the less you'll need to worry about some of those "first conversation" concerns. For example, finishing someone's sentences when you're really vibing can deepen a connection, but if you're not at that level yet, even a couple such interruptions can absolutely _kill_ the vibe, so use with caution. Plus everyone's tolerance for it is different, and differs day by day. Your girlfriend telling you about how her resident discussion-section douchebag mansplains everything does _not_ need you finishing her sentences, trust me.

I'll reiterate this just once more -- listening skills will remain THE most important part of maintaining a good relationship at any level (Do you disagree? Good, think for yourself! I don't have comments set up on this thing yet, and I may never do so. Share your thoughts with someone in your own life!). But there's another level that really comes into play here, but doesn't so much in "professional" contexts.

I don't think I need to stress the importance of honesty in any relationship. If you're reading this and don't appreciate that yet, you might be a lost cause. But honesty has different shades to it, and I think the primary distinction to be drawn between more personal and more professional relationships is around so-called "lies of omission."

What counts as a "lie of omission?"

I have a long and very boring half-story, half-lecture around the what and the why of my first, and currently only, tattoo (look forward to a _riveting_ post about it some day). I don't tell it to strangers or passing acquaintances lest they regret they asked; I have a much shortened spiel on the "what" and leave it at that unless they ask further. But this is something I have permanently emblazoned in a very visible spot on my right forearm. When a friend asks, I try to give them as complete a picture as their patience will allow. It's a way of opening up to them and showing a little vulnerability, letting them into my world, and showing them that I value them enough to do so. If I don't seem willing to divulge the whole story, or constantly apologize for it, or make them keep needling me with questions to get it out of me, it's going to create cognitive dissonance in their mind. "If he got it in such a visible place, why doesn't he want to talk about it?" And, you know, maybe after I've given them the whole story, it will turn out they didn't find it that compelling. But they know a little more about me, even if that takeaway is just "he's a _huge_ nerd," and they know I'm willing to be honest with them, even if the thing I'm telling them is not necessarily going to "advance" the relationship.

So, giving incomplete answers to questions is a pretty straightforward category of lies of omission, and it's a dial you can adjust depending on the context and the strength of the relationship.

Another category is when you want something, and you don't tell someone. I mean, have some tact. But if your needs and wants are going unmet in a relationship (romantic or otherwise) because the other person hasn't managed to guess them, it's YOU who is doing something wrong.

But where the lies of omission will really get you is when something is happening that you don't like, and you don't speak up. No one is ever going to advocate for you better than you could for yourself. I say "could" because you can obviously abdicate this responsibility and rely on friends or partners to do it for you. I mean, maybe you're not the assertive type, and someone dear to you is much more gregarious. Guess what - you at least need to tell _them_ what you want and what you don't.

My first four serious relationships -- which is, uh... all of them, up until I met my wife -- had problems stemming from my lack of communication with someone. In a few cases, trying to "let them down easy" or simply being afraid to admit to them that I felt the relationship wasn't working resulted in less-than-ideal breakups. Once, I rushed into things and pushed to define the relationship too early (which doesn't really fit into the "lies of omission" theme here, but that's what happened). And most memorably, one of those relationships barely got off the ground before it was killed by a TV-worthy love-triangle situation involving a friend and I both being interested in the same woman. It was _entirely_ preventable had I simply told the friend when I noticed him flirting - "Hey, listen, I've actually been interested in her, I think she might be interested in me - do you think you could do me a huge favor and be my wingman here since you two obviously get along as well?" I'm sad to say that poor communication continued for weeks amidst all three parties -- for which I take the lion's share of the responsibility -- and it damaged all of our relationships with each other. I'd like to think we've repaired them now, and I count both of the other people involved as friends today. That didn't happen without a few painful, honest conversations, and a few external factors that forced us to remain in each others' lives to some extent. The moral of the story: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. It's tough, but you've got to tell the people in your life when something is _not_ working for you, or it will continue to fester until it explodes, or you'll simply be unhappy forever.
