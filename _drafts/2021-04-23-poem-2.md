What is not, but could be
The would-be forward thinking hard things
Ringing with potentiality.

It’s not, but if you want it
Take it, dauntless,
With you going back to forward
Not because your knack for words is worth a damn
But because you don’t give one

Manifest your capital
Accumulated restlessness
No laurels, ruminations on past glories
Poison
Dread and angst and shame and sloth and
And
And

Airgapped security systems can’t breathe.
Clean the dust off your intake fans
Rust of many moons oxidizes the next layer
Until you need to swap a part.
The meme pool diversifies
Unnatural selection natural in provenance nonetheless
Indeed, direction radically post-hoc
Insists itself upon narratives
Whereupon
Arrogance of highest order, paraphrasing
Parasitic soporific sophomoric ego.

You’ve told us that a thousand times before,
Give it a rest.
We know.
Feed your damn people.
