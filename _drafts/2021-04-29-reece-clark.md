Reece is a friend of mine from college, and he has no idea I'm doing this. I mean, maybe the slightest hint. We joked via text this evening about the fact that I own this domain and have started a blog, and we discovered that reececlark.com is available. I humorously proposed that he buy the domain and install crypto mining javascript bloat to it. It was a good conversation.

One of the main reasons it was good, is because Reece Clark is a good man.

He is a doctor: a full, Medical Doctor, currently working as a resident. He works incredibly hard, under a lot of stress, and for too little pay -- but maybe I'll write more about that side of things another time. For now, I want to focus on Reece. What makes him a good man? Ineffable magic of personality aside, there are qualifiable characteristics -- as is true for everyone.

Reece is kind. He is unwaveringly supportive. If he asks you a question, you can be sure he actually wants to hear your answer, and that he actually cares what that answer is. When you ask him a question, he is open, honest, and polite.
