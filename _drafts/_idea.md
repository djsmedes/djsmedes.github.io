Scifi but with more fantasy feel, where one kind of magic relies on enhancing obscure human senses, or adding senses, with nano-implants. Like, an mRNA contructble - you could like get injected, and then eat a huge meal with a lot of some specific amino acids or some special molecule or element that it needs a lot of. This processed could be very mystified, and we see someone undergo it.

Also this tech could build really high quality nanoscale computer interfaces with human neurons.

An interesting way to run this in DND is that magic does exist, but this technology can also forge links between human neurons and the Weave of magic.

Gods are AIs. Steal this shit right from Hyperion. Actually is this sounding too much like Ilium? How did Dan Simmons give his gods their powers? Idk, maybe I just steal that and go with it.
