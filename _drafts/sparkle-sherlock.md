# Chapter 1

It cannot be need that drives him.

A needy man might commit such an act, true. But Alan Watts dressed like shit for a carpenter of his purported skill, and his horse couldn't win a race against a one-legged lizard. The rough burlap sack that was still intact was apparently full of oats, and the horse was apparently aware of this fact. It was slowly turning in a circle, snorting and craning its neck as if it thought that maybe on _this_ revolution it would be able to reach its own flank.

Watts himself limped up, leading a leatherworker. He eyed the ring of salt on the ground with a slight wrinkling of his nose. A few grains were still being added to the ring, shaken loose from the frayed slash in the other sack, with every step the horse took.

"Whoa, No-Toes," he said. He continued to speak as he removed the sack of oats, filled a feed bag with it, and affixed that to the horse's head. More soft words for the horse, and some probably unneeded instructions for the leatherworker on how he should fix the damaged stirrup. 

Watts was really quite lucky the roadside inn happened to be hosting a man of that profession. He'd otherwise have had an awkward ride home or needed to convince some other traveler to sell him a saddle. He was in no condition to make the trip on foot. Another group of travelers who had just come in from the west were hitching their horses, but  they didn't look to have any spare saddles. They looked to be merchants, not craftsmen. Craftsmen usually had no reason to travel the Ashen Road.

Watts finally turned to Freya. "Did you have any other questions, Constable?"

"Maybe," Freya said, "but you haven't yet answered those I've already asked. Chiefly -- _Why_ did you pack them in salt?"

"I did answer that! So's nobody would know I was carryin' 'em!"

"Yes, a wise decision to keep them hidden. But why _salt_?"

"Why, it's a fine thing to trade, my Lady Constable. I came into a supply of such, and thought to pad my pocket a bit, so long as I was makin' the journey anyhow."

"You intended to sell salt... in Salton? You are aware of the provenance of that name?"

"Well, I... as I said, I came into a fair supply... but it's not my usual trade, y'know... I... wanted to know the quality. Learn what I might hope to earn from my bounty. From one who knows it best!"

"I see." Freya did. It was her job -- to see what others missed. "Very well. I have no further questions. Make sure you remove that bandage before sleep this night and wash the wound again. Desperate cutpurses are not known to keep the cleanest blades."

"I'll follow yer wisdom, my Lady Constable, I thank ya fer- m'lady? Where are ya goin'?"

"Salton."

"But what about me [macguffins]?! That thievin' bastard ran back East, like as not to hide in the Wood! Slashed me right good and swiped them [macguffins], but he hardly slowed down, he's likely halfway ta-"

"He could be anywhere in the Once-Burnt Wood by now, Master Watts. I cannot simply chase him down. I do not think Lord Harmon wanted those [macguffins] simply to melt them into new mint. He may know more."

"But what am I ta do?"

"Rest here and return home tomorrow. I will find you in Ferrybough when I've recovered your property. And as I told you -- wash that wound."

# Notes

Ring of salt should be foreshadowing of something
