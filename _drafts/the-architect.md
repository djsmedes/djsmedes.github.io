# Outline
## free writing
### setup
- rising star in biochemistry/molecular biology, The Billionaire, comes up with a way to grow buildings using garbage and carbon sequestered from the air
- combination of insights from fungi (mycelium networks infiltrating garbage & producing chemicals which can break that shit down), plants (growing using air carbon, tall strong structures, integrated solar panels that grow like leaves), embryology (chemical gradients to direct development of previously undifferentiated building blocks - think stem cells). Incorporates metals and polymers into structures as well. Maybe some of these innovations were made by other companies which his company then bought
- the tech for degrading garbage could apply just as well a) if you're not building a building out of it - could just convert to raw materials or b) to demolish the same structures it builds.
- both growth and decay are controlled by chemical-gradient apparatus and it's all a tightly controlled secret by The Billionaire and his company
- legal battles by environmentalist government bodies to force him to turn over the secret so that they can use it to clean up the planet; The Billionaire is fighting this (is he cartoonishly evil and just wants to hoard money and callously doesn't care about the poors of the world? Does he realize the potential for problems if it gets released? Maybe important infrastructure has already been converted and giving access to the decay tech would put it at risk because someone could hit it with an enzyme bomb that would cause the building to just eat itself? 
- Maybe he's open-sourced parts of the growth side of the tech (maybe just an API where you can create templates?), but only in such a way that it will work with highly pure raw materials, which his decay tech can provide if you license it, or much more expensively you can supply the raw materials the traditional way (or maybe you have to license out his construction frames + crews to actually build your template?)
### protagonist
- young-ish software developer getting in early on a possible unicorn startup. Two co-founders, architecture students who drop out and start working on producing AI-assisted design templates using the growth technology. structures that become more organic, better use fractal patterns to efficiently use materials / transport resources / cool themselves / ... etc
- "self-healing" materials have been around, but no one has yet succeeded at the idea to alter The Billionaire's growth tech to be self-healing. It's currently very much a 3D-printing-like process.
- because the underlying technology is still a secret at the beginning of the story, no one has any serious research into how to do self-healing with it
- maybe Protagonist makes some kind of lucky guess about the process during his early work at the company, or there's a happy coincidence in how his AI code works with it or something.
- maybe the fractal, space-filling, nature-y aspect of the AI's designs make that work really well
- major early turning point in the story - when the court battle goes from something foreshadowed and built up in the background to the foreground, is when the government literally detains The Billionaire temporarily in order to seize the technology; it intends to keep it a secret managed by governments, but it ends up leaking out due to old out-of-touch politicians not understanding something about it and therefore failing to keep it secret
### The race is on
- this section focuses on competition between startups and others to produce self-healing, trash-eating buildings. The government offers an incentive of exclusive rights to the technology, which the government will then license and therefore pay a fee to, the first company that can achieve some benchmarks
- different startups are using different methods. multiple ones using AI to try and generate functional designs
- protagonist's startup has a leg up because they were already doing that / by luck, their method they were already working on happened to mesh really well
- turning point: they succeed, get the rights, and become fabulously wealthy. the protagonist came in early and got a decent slice of equity, but the co-founders (and venture capitalists?) keep most of it. Protagonist still becomes fabulously wealthy.
### time skip - things are going great
- co-founders hang with The Billionaire, do speaking circuit, are VCs themselves, etc
- protagonist is CEO of the company
- problems start to arise: the design AI comes up with a "mutation" of the self-healing tech: "seeds". Little building "seedlings" start sprouting near construction sites and have to be "weeded"
- they accidentally cause selection pressure in the real world and the buildings evolve to the point where their reproduction cannot be stopped
- the "seeds" spread via air travel all over like a pandemic
- they take root and start very small, getting everywhere
### the Fall (another time skip)
- then people start noticing, and it's way too late
- they take over and destroy the world's infrastructure
- (foreshadow this all with stuff about invasive species thrown in earlier? Something calling humanity an invasive species?)
- maintaining traditional structures becomes impossible. rainforests are destroyed too. planet is remade with these things as the dominant form of life. humans basically revert to hunter-gatherers living among them
## themes
- people being shitty, selfish, destructive, corrupted by power, and able to use their wealth to corrupt institutions
- Enriching yourself off the suffering of others vs earning a reward for helping solve one the most important issues of our time
