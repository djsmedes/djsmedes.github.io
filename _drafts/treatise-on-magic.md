# Treatise on Magic

There are many types of magic. 

## Ferromancy
The magic utilizing pure materials. When a substance that is atomically a pure element is fixed to certain positions and patterns against a living body, that body will be conferred some effect, usually done for benefit.

So named because the first element used for the technique was iron. In most cases metals are still used, because they are the most easily purified elements; however, interesting recent developments in chemistry have isolated more pure elements.

The effects metals have on the body tend to vary between families, while the particular patterns required to achieve those effects varies randomly from one person to the next. One clan, when they wear silver rings on the right fingers, may gain the ability to manifest blades. Another, when given tattoos inlaid with gold ink, gained heightened perception and enhanced reflexes.
