This is a site generated using Jekyll and hosted in GitHub pages.
I tried WordPress, but hated all the zillions of configuration settings,
but paradoxically lack of control over the content of the actual site.
I don't need anything fancy -- if I do, I'll program it my own damn self and
make the Jekyll bits just a subsection of the site. I don't want Google Analytics
or any other pile of javascript loading in and mucking everything up. I just want
a simple website where I can write.
