I am a lecturer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the iSchool (Information School). I'm teaching Introduction to Web Development in Fall '25. I'm also a graduate student in Computer Sciences here at UW.

Before that, I worked as a software engineer for 8 years, co-founding Encamp (https://encamp.com/) and serving as the leader of the software side in the early stages.

I'm originally from Indianapolis. I graduated from Indiana University in 2015 with a dual degree in Cognitive Science and Computer Science. I now live with my family, including our new puppy, Daisy, in Dane County, Wisconsin.
