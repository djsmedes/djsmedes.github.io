I am a graduate student in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Before that, I worked as a software engineer for 8 years, co-founding Encamp (https://encamp.com/) and serving as the leader of the software side in the early years.

I'm originally from Indianapolis. I graduated from Southport High School in 2011 and Indiana University in 2015 with a dual degree in Cognitive Science and Computer Science. I now live with my family, including our new puppy, Daisy, in Dane County, Wisconsin.
